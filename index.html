      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With over 8 years of experience as a software engineer, 
        I have focused primarily on backend web development and have contributed to projects across various domains, 
        including education, hospitality, and finance. 
        My expertise lies in designing and building microservices, deploying them on AWS, and creating robust web applications using Python and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In my current role, I lead a team of ten developers for a US-based fintech startup specializing in student loans. 
        Beyond being an individual contributor, I engage with the clients to understand their requirements and objectives, 
        develop low and high-level system design strategies, and conduct code reviews to ensure the quality and maintainability of our deliverables. 
        Additionally, I actively participate in onboarding and training new team members.
