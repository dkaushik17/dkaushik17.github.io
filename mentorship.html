      <h2>Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my commitment to fostering growth and excellence in the tech industry, I have developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for new hires. This program is designed to equip developers with the essential skills needed in modern backend development.
      </p>
      <h3>Training Program Highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Python programming fundamentals and advanced concepts</li>
        <li>SQL database design and optimization</li>
        <li>Django web framework and RESTful API development</li>
        <li>Asynchronous task processing with Celery</li>
        <li>Microservice architecture principles and implementation</li>
        <li>AWS cloud services and deployment strategies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To date, I have successfully mentored and trained 15 junior developers through this program. I'm proud to say that all of these developers have gone on to perform exceptionally well in their roles, contributing significantly to our team's success.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mentorship experience has not only allowed me to share my knowledge and expertise but has also reinforced my own understanding of these technologies. It's been incredibly rewarding to watch these developers grow and thrive in their careers.
